ignore_bad_ethernets = True
@ignore_bad_ethernets = When True if any non ethernet chip claims it has a IP address this is logged and ignored
    When False the whole chip is removed
report_waiting_logs = False
@report_waiting_logs = Debugging option. If True adds logging while the host waits on cores to be in a particular state.
turn_off_machine = False
@turn_off_machine = Adds an optional step to the end of the simulation to turn of [physically connected boards](machine_name).
spalloc_machine = None
@spalloc_machine = Name of the Spalloc Machine to be used.
   Optional unless the [URL](spalloc_server) points to multiple spalloc manchines.
spalloc_use_proxy = True
@spalloc_use_proxy = Indicates that the spalloc proxy server is needed.
   Needed to access spalloc from a different network.
   Jupiter notebook users should leave this as set by the server admin.
bmp_names = None
@bmp_names = Only needed for [physical board(s)](machine_name) with both am Ethernet and BMP cable connected.

   format is:
   *  bmp_names     = <host>[/(<board-range>|board_id[,board_id]*)
   *  <board_range> = <board_id>-<board_id>

   where:
   * <host> is the hostname or IP address of the BMP
   * <board_range> is a range of boards that the BMP can speak to
   * <board_id> is the ID of a single board in a frame

   Note this no longer supports multiple host nor cabinet or frame

auto_detect_bmp = False
@auto_detect_bmp = Only needed for [physical board(s)](machine_name) with both am Ethernet and BMP cable connected.
   If True the assumption is the BMP IP addresss is one less than the [Ethernet](machine_name)
reset_machine_on_startup = False
@reset_machine_on_startup =
  Will power cycle the boards at startup.
  Not needed normally.
