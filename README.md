This package provides utilities for interacting with a SpiNNaker machine.

Requirements

In addition to a standard Python installation, this package depends on:

 - SpiNNMachine

These requirements can be install using pip:

    pip install SpiNNMachine

User Installation

If you want to install for all users, run:

    sudo pip install SpiNNMan

If you want to install only for yourself, run:

    pip install SpiNNMan --user

To install in a virtualenv, with the virtualenv enabled, run:

    pip install SpiNNMan

Developer Installation
======================
If you want to be able to edit the source code, but still have it referenced
from other Python modules, you can set the install to be a developer install.
In this case, download the source code, and extract it locally, or else clone
the git repository:

    git clone http://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester/SpiNNMan.git

To install as a development version which all users will then be able to use,
run the following where the code has been extracted:

    sudo pip install -e .

To install as a development version for only yourself, run:

    pip install -e . --user

To install as a development version in a `virtualenv`, with the `virutalenv`
enabled, run:

    pip install -e .
